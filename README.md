I’ve successfully completed a data analysis project where I explored the unemployment trends in India using Python 📊

📌 What I Did:

Cleaned and processed real unemployment data

Visualized trends across regions using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates

Identified seasonal patterns and regional differences

Gained insights that can help inform social and economic policies

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

This project gave me a solid understanding of data cleaning, trend analysis, and storytelling with data.
Excited to apply these skills to real-world problems!
